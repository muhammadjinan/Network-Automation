# SET
A **set** is a built-in data type in Python that is used to store collections of data. It is one of the four built-in data types in Python, the other three being list, tuple, and dictionary. A set is a collection of unique and immutable elements that are unordered and unindexed. This means that the order of elements in a set is undefined, and you cannot access individual elements by their index. However, you can add or remove elements from a set, and perform set operations such as union, intersection, and difference on sets.
- `Unordered,` `unindexed,` and `unchangable`
- `No duplicates` are considered
- `Unchangable` but you can `remove` items and `add` items
- A **set** consider `True` & `1` as same and `False` & `0` as same
