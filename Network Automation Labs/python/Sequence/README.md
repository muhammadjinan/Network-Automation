- Python supports six different types of sequences: **strings, lists, tuples, byte sequences, byte arrays, and range objects.** [~](https://techvidvan.com/tutorials/python-sequences/)
- You can perform various operations and functions on sequences, such as counting, checking, slicing, finding, and concatenating.[~](https://www.pythontutorial.net/advanced-python/python-sequences/)


### ARRAY
- An **Array** is special *variable,* which can `hold more than one value at a time.`
- Arrays are useful when you have a list of items and want to store them under a single name.
